This is an excerpt of the ISA-TAB description in http://isatab.sourceforge.net/docs/ISA-TAB_release-candidate-1_v1.0_24nov08.pdf
The lines marked with * are comments, attempting to map ISA-TAB fields to a RDF representation.



Study:
characteristics; subjects

=============
4.1.1 Ontology source section 

Term source name, file, source version, description

* There is no reason for a separate section in RDF representation. 
* Ontologies can be imported and referred to by the standard means.
* RDF Terms from ontologies are referred by standard means (URI)


=============
4.1.2. Investigation section

* Provides means to group several studies together.  May be useful in TB, but optional.
* Investigation file can be generated on the fly, when exporting as ISA-TAB is requested.
* Or later an Investigation resource could be introduced.


4.1.2.1 INVESTIGATION
Investigation Identifier
A locally unique identifier or an accession number provided by a repository.
Investigation Title
A concise name given to the investigation
Investigation Description
A textual description of the investigation
Investigation Submission Date
The date on which the investigation was reported to the repository.
Investigation Public Release Date
The date on which the investigation should be released publicly.
 
* If Investigation is aresource, these above could be predefined properties. 
* If generated on the fly, could be requested to be entered upon export (does it make sense?)

4.1.2.2 INVESTIGATION PUBLICATIONS
Each publication associated with an Investigation has its own column in the Investigation Publication section.
Such publications are specifically dealing with the investigation as a whole. Publications relating to the specific
Studies may be referenced in the Study sections. Information may be supplied using as many additional
columns as needed.
 Investigation PubMed ID
The PubMed IDs of the described publication(s) associated with this investigation.
 Investigation Publication DOI
A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for that publication (where available).
 Investigation Publication Author List
The list of authors associated with that publication.
 Investigation Publication Title
The title of publication associated with the investigation.
 Investigation Publication Status
A term describing the status of that publication (i.e. submitted, in preparation, published).
 Investigation Publication Status Term Accession Number
The accession number from the Term Source associated with the selected term.
 Investigation Publication Status Term Source REF
Identifies the controlled vocabulary or ontology that this term comes from. The Source REF has to
match one the Term Source Name declared in the in the ontology section 4.1.1.

*This refers to the investigation as a whole. 
May not be relevant to the initial phase of TB/seurat, but definitely worth to have 
possibilty to group studies and assign a higher level context.
Especially in terms of (future) publications, which will likely refer to several studies.

4.1.2.3 INVESTIGATION CONTACTS
Investigation Person Last Name
...
Investigation Person Address
The address of a person associated with the investigation.
Investigation Person Affiliation
The organization affiliation for a person associated with the investigation.
Investigation Person Roles
Investigation Person Roles Term Accession Number 

* Same arguments as for the previous section.  Person roles could come from an ontology.

==================
4.1.3 Study section

-Study Identifier
A unique identifier: either a temporary identifier supplied by users or one generated by a repository or
other database. For example, it could be an identifier complying with the LSID specification.

*An LSID is represented as a Uniform Resource Name (URN) with the following format.
URN:LSID:<Authority>:<Namespace>:<ObjectID>[:<Version>]
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSID

*We could generate LSID style identifier by internal identifiers, version, etc. 
*Or use a centralized service to generate LSIDs?
* dc:identifier 
 

-Study Title
A concise phrase used to encapsulate the purpose and goal of the study.

* Use Dublin Core metadata, described at http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/
* eg. dc:title or dcterms
* The notes below use dcterms: as prefix for http://purl.org/dc/terms

-Study Description
A textual description of the study, with components such as objective or goals.

* http://purl.org/dc/terms/abstract , or shortly dcterms:abstract 
* or http://purl.org/dc/terms/description ?

-Study Submission Date
The date on which the study is submitted to an archive.

* http://purl.org/dc/terms/created  ; dctemrs:created
*or http://purl.org/dc/terms/dateSubmitted dcterms:dateSubmitted ??

-Study Public Release Date
The date on which the study should be released publicly.

* dcterms:available  http://purl.org/dc/terms/available

-Study File Name
A field to specify the name of the Study file corresponding the definition of that Study. There can be
only one file per cell. In case, implementers wish to split the Study Files on their nodes (i.e Source
Name and Sample Name), a process which results in multiple files being necessary to report the
same information, they should create a bundle archive with files and report the name of the archive,
thereby complying with the one file only rule.

* Study resource URI , or/and file name when exported as ISA-TAB
* The study resource should probably have the same /study/{id} returning metadata and /study/{id}/file 
returning content -

-Study Factor Name
The name of one factor used in the Study and/or Assay files. A factor corresponds to an independent
variable manipulated by the experimentalist with the intention to affect biological systems in a way
that can be measured by an assay. The value of a factor is given in the Study or Assay file,
accordingly. If both Study and Assay have a Factor Value (see section 4.2.5 and 4.3.1.5,
respectively), these must be different.

EFO ontology

* Analogous to ot:Feature
* Could use 
* <study> tb:hasFactor <thefactor>.
* <theFactor> dc:title <here-the-factor-name>.
* <thefactor> rdf:type <http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0000001>.    //this is top level experimental factor in EFO
* ??? derive from ot:Feature or vice versa

------
4.1.3.5 STUDY ASSAYS

The Study Assay section declares and describes each of the Assay files associated with the current Study.

* This seems just to establish links between studies and assays
* Isn't it better to have Assay metadata in the Assays themselves, and just link Study and Assay URIs?
* <study1> tb:hasAssay <Assay1>.


Study Assay Measurement Type
A term to qualify the endpoint, or what is being measured (e.g. gene expression profiling or protein
identification). The term can be free text or from, for example, a controlled vocabulary or an ontology.

- Study Assay File Name
A field to specify the name of the Assay file corresponding the definition of that assay. There can be
only one file per cell. In case, implementers wish to split the Assay Files on their nodes, a process
which results in multiple files being necessary to report the same information, they should create a
bundle archive with files and report the name of the archive, thereby complying with the one file only
rule.

* Assay URI or file when exporting as ISA-TAB
* Again /assay/{id}  for metadata and /assay/{id}/file for files

4.2 Study file

In the Study file the fields are organized on a per-row basis, the first row containing column headers. The
Study file contains contextualizing information for one or more assays. The sections below describe in details
the Study file column’s headers, organizing them as nodes (potentially containing the string Name or File,
previously referred to as ‘sections’), and attributes (previously referred to as ‘fields’) for nodes and node
processing events, qualifiers for node attributes, and other valid fields.
