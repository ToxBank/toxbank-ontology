This is an excerpt of the ISA-TAB description in http://isatab.sourceforge.net/docs/ISA-TAB_release-candidate-1_v1.0_24nov08.pdf
The lines marked with * are comments, attempting to map ISA-TAB fields to a RDF representation.



Study:
characteristics; subjects

=============
4.1.1 Ontology source section 

Term source name, file, source version, description

* There is no reason for a separate section in RDF representation. 
* Ontologies can be imported and referred to by the standard means.
* RDF Terms from ontologies are referred by standard means (URI)


=============
4.1.2. Investigation section

* Provides means to group several studies together.  May be useful in TB, but optional.
* Investigation file can be generated on the fly, when exporting as ISA-TAB is requested.
* Or later an Investigation resource could be introduced.

Investigation Title
A concise name given to the investigation
Investigation Description
A textual description of the investigation
Investigation Submission Date
The date on which the investigation was reported to the repository.
Investigation Public Release Date
The date on which the investigation should be released publicly.
 
* If Investigation is aresource, these above could be predefined properties. 
* If generated on the fly, could be requested to be entered upon export (does it make sense?)

4.1.2.2 INVESTIGATION PUBLICATIONS
Each publication associated with an Investigation has its own column in the Investigation Publication section.
Such publications are specifically dealing with the investigation as a whole. Publications relating to the specific
Studies may be referenced in the Study sections. Information may be supplied using as many additional

match one the Term Source Name declared in the in the ontology section 4.1.1.

*This refers to the investigation as a whole. 
May not be relevant to the initial phase of data modeling, but definitely worth to have 
possibilty to group studies and assign a higher level context.
Especially in terms of (future) publications, which will likely refer to several studies.

==================
4.1.3 Study section

-Study Identifier
A unique identifier: either a temporary identifier supplied by users or one generated by a repository or
other database. For example, it could be an identifier complying with the LSID specification.

*An LSID is represented as a Uniform Resource Name (URN) with the following format.
URN:LSID:<Authority>:<Namespace>:<ObjectID>[:<Version>]
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSID

*We could generate LSID style identifier by internal identifiers, version, etc. 
*Or use a centralized service to generate LSIDs?
* dc:identifier 
 

-Study Title
A concise phrase used to encapsulate the purpose and goal of the study.

* Use Dublin Core metadata, described at http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/
* eg. dc:title or dcterms
* The notes below use dcterms: as prefix for http://purl.org/dc/terms

-Study Description
A textual description of the study, with components such as objective or goals.

* http://purl.org/dc/terms/abstract , or shortly dcterms:abstract

* dcterms:available  http://purl.org/dc/terms/available

-Study File Name
A field to specify the name of the Study file corresponding the definition of that Study. There can be
only one file per cell. In case, implementers wish to split the Study Files on their nodes (i.e Source
Name and Sample Name), a process which results in multiple files being necessary to report the
same information, they should create a bundle archive with files and report the name of the archive,
thereby complying with the one file only rule.

* Study resource URI , or/and file name when exported as ISA-TAB
* The study resource should probably have the same /study/{id} returning metadata and /study/{id}/file 
returning content -

4.2 Study file

In the Study file the fields are organized on a per-row basis, the first row containing column headers. The
Study file contains contextualizing information for one or more assays. The sections below describe in details
the Study file column’s headers, organizing them as nodes (potentially containing the string Name or File,
previously referred to as ‘sections’), and attributes (previously referred to as ‘fields’) for nodes and node
processing events, qualifiers for node attributes, and other valid fields.

* Studies generally describe the subject of the study, how they are prepared. 
* The results are in the assay files.

------

4.2.1 Study nodes

* ??? These are the steps of the study in fact !
* Protocols not nesessarily correspond to assays, there might be protocols, which do not lead to data generation.
(e.g. feeding animals)
*And there could beprotocol, which are data processing events, not operating on biological entities.

-Source Name

qualified using the following headers: 

--Characteristics [ ], 
--Material Type, 
--Term Source REF, 
--Term
--Accession Number, 
--Unit, 
--Provider, 
--Description, and Comment [ ].

-Sample Name

Samples represent major outputs resulting from a protocol application other than the special case
outputs of Extract or a Labeled Extract. Sample items can be qualified using the following headers:

--Characteristics [ ]
--Material Type
--Term Accession Number

--Unit
--Comment [ ].

------

4.2.2 Attributes of Study nodes

latter source is used the Term Accession Number and Term Source REF fields below are required.

-Characteristics [<category term>]
Used as an attribute column following Source Name, Sample Name. This column contains terms
describing each material according to the characteristics category indicated in the column header. For
example, a column header "Characteristics [organism part]" would contain terms describing an
organism part. The term can be free text or from, for example, a controlled vocabulary or an ontology.
If the latter source is used the Term Accession Number and Term Source REF fields are required. If
the characteristic being reported is a measurement, a Unit column (with qualifying Term Source REF
and Term Accession Number) may be also be used

- Provider ([STDYID])
Used as an attribute column following Source Name. It can be appended with the [STDYID] tag only
in the context of referencing Sources used in a SDTM data submission. This mechanism would allow
listing subject identifiers coming from several different SDTM submissions. See section 5.3 for
implementation guidelines.

-------

4.2.3 Attributes of processing events for Study nodes

-Protocol REF
One or more Protocol REF columns should be used to specify the method used to transform a
material or a data node. This column contains a reference to a Protocol Name (previously defined in
the Investigation File) or to accession numbers of protocols already present in public repositories.
Protocol REF can be further refined with the following elements:

-Parameter Value [<parameter term>]
The field allows reporting on the values taken by the parameter when applying a protocol.
Note that the term between [ ] must map to one (and only one) of parameters defined in the
investigation file. Values can be qualitative or quantitative. Refer to section 5 on design
pattern for additional information.

-Performer
Name of the operator who carried out the protocol. This allows account to be taken of
operator effects and can be part of a quality control data tracking.

-Date
The date on which a protocol is performed. This allows account to be taken of day effects and

=================
4.3 Assay file

In the Assay file the fields are organized on a per-row basis, the first row containing column headers. 

The Assay file represents a set of assays, defined by the 
-- endpoint measured (i.e. gene expression) and 
-- the technology employed (i.e. DNA microarray), as described in the Investigation file. 
An assay file can refer to one or more external data files, see section 2.4.

* hence /assay/{id} -> technology & endpoint; /assay/{id}/file -> the content

------
4.3.1 Generic Assay file structure

This section holds a list of (generic) column headers to describe several types of assays, organized
as: 

-nodes (containing the string Name or File), 
-attributes for these nodes, 
-attributes for node processing events, 
-qualifiers for the node’s attributes and other valid fields.

* everything wich contan "Name" or "File" is considered an identifier!
* The assay does not contain the data itself, it is still metadata!
* Basically, assay names are identifiers for the combination of input factors
* pointing to the data files.

4.3.1.1 Assay nodes

-Sample Name (or Source Name)
Sample Name is used as an identifier to refer to from within the Study file. Thereby associating it with
the Source Name in that Study file. Source Name in the Assay file can only be qualified with
Comment [ ]. However, in experiments where the source (starting biological material used in a study)
is also the sample (measured in the assay) the Source Name acts as the identifier to link the Assay to
its Study file. For example, a whole body scan by NMR where the body is both source and sample,
(i.e., used in toto, rather than in part).

* the row is the bioentity

processing. Where data from multiple hybridizations is stored in a single file, the data should be
mapped to the appropriate hybridization (or scan, or normalization) via the Data Matrix format itself
[9].

- Array Design File
Column to provide name of file containing the array design, used for a particular hybridization. For
submission or transfer, ADF files can be packaged with ISA-TAB files into an ISArchive, see section
2.4.

- Array Design REF
This column is used to reference the identifier (or accession number) of an existing array design.

4.3.3 Assay file with Technology Type: Gel electrophoresis
Extending the list given in section 4.3.1, this type of Assay file contains additional nodes and nodes relabeled
with more specific name, in line with other domain-specific formats and associated reference repositories (6,
10, 12, 22).

* technology specific. Could it be defined in an ontology which technology needs which fields?
* Or perhaps already is?

- Gel Electrophoresis Assay Name (in place of Assay Name)
Used as an identifier within the Assay file. This column contains user-defined names for each
electrophoresis gel assay. For 2-dimensional gels, the following qualifying headers can be used
instead:

- First Dimension
The term can be free text or from, for example, a controlled vocabulary or an ontology. If the
latter source is used the Term Accession Number and Term Source REF fields are required.

- Second Dimension
The term can be free text or from, for example, a controlled vocabulary or an ontology. If the
latter source is used the Term Accession Number and Term Source REF fields are required.

- Scan Name
Used as an identifier within the Assay file. This column contains user-defined names for each Scan
event.

- Spot Picking File
Column to provide name (or URI) of files file holding protein spot coordinates and metadata for use by
spot picking instruments.
The node attributes and remaining fields are as described in section 4.3.1.

4.3.4 Assay file with Technology Type: Mass Spectrometry (MS)
Extending the list given in section 4.3.1, this type of Assay file contains additional nodes and nodes relabeled
with more specific name, in line with other domain-specific formats and associated reference repositories (6,
12,18).

-MS Assay Name (in place of Assay Name)
Used as an identifier within the Assay file. This column contains user-defined names for each MS
Assay.

-Raw Spectral Data File (in place of Raw Data File)
Column to provide name (or URI) of ‘raw’ spectral data files.

-Derived Spectral Data File (in place of Derived Data File)
Column to provide name (or URI) of derived spectral data files, resulting from data transformation or
processing.
When Mass Spectrometry is used in proteomics the following data files are required, according to PSI
specifications and Pride submission requirements (6, 10):

-Peptide Assignment File
Column to provide name (or URI) of file(s) containing peptide assignments.

-Protein Assignment File
Column to provide name (or URI) of file(s) containing protein assignments.

-Post Translational Modification Assignment File
Column to provide name (or URI) of file(s) containing posited post-translational modifications.
Capturing data resulting from the use of mass spectrometry in metabol/nomics requires a settled
definition for a Metabolite Assignment File (inter alia); such a file is currently under development in
collaboration with the Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI, 18)
The node attributes and remaining fields are as described in section 4.3.1.

------
4.3.5 Assay file with Technology Type: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (NMR)
Extending the list given in section 4.3.1, this type of Assay file contains additional nodes and nodes relabeled
with more specific name, in line with other domain-specific formats (12,18).

* technology specific

- NMR Assay Name (in place of Assay Name)
Used as an identifier within the Assay file. This column contains user-defined names for each NMR
Assay
-Free Induction Decay Data File (in place of Raw Data File)
Column to provide name (or an URI) of files corresponding to the free induction decay data files.

-Acquisition Parameter Data File
Column to provide name (or an URI) of files corresponding to the acquisition parameters data files.

-Derived Spectral Data File (in place of Derived Data File)
Column to provide name (or an URI) of files corresponding to derived spectral data files, resulting
from data transformation or processing.
Capturing data resulting from the use of NMR spectrometry in metabol/nomics requires a settled
definition for a Metabolite Assignment File (inter alia); such a file is currently under development in

5. Design patterns for Study and Assay files

5.1 Representing node processing

Conceptually, a protocol takes one or more inputs (biological material or data) and generates one or more
outputs (biological material or data). Therefore protocols correspond to edges in the experimental graph, while
materials and data correspond to the nodes. The following example shows how to represent the
transformation of a node, the operator and the date by referecing its protocol (declared in the STUDY
PROTOCOLS section of the Investigation file) and also shows the optional performer and date columns:

Node Name | Protocol REF | Performer | Date | Node Name

* This is quite close to the OpenTox concept of a procesing algorithm  dataset -- (algorithm) --> dataset 
* The links could be made explicit in RDF
